This extension contains currently:

- an new version of the update inventory qty process that allows to keep the
  current count qty when updating the book qty.

To enable the new inventory qty update process you'll have to change the Process
field of the UpdateQty Column of the M_Inventory Table to "M_Inventory Update
Booking Count" after the Plugin is unpacked and the new AD Entries are
generated.
